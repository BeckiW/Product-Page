# Sprint 2 – Build a Product Listing with React

In today's assignment we are going to build a product listing in React. You specific e-commerce store is a pharmacy so we are going to list pharmacuticals. To do so you have a JSON file with all the product information and you are going to use React components to list all the items on the page. 

In the end it will look something like this: 

## How to complete this assignment


## React Components

Start by thinking of how to divide your page into React components, where the product should be one component. 

How to setup React.... 

Code your product component to make it look like you want it to look (meaning one of the squares). 

## Iterate over the data

In the `product.json`file there's an array of prodcuts in a json format –– Javascript objects. This is the data you will be using to fill you product listing. 

You're task is to iterate over the array and create and render one component for each product. Every product listing should have the following data rendered: 

* `name`
* `price`
* `description`
* `imageLink`
* `deliveryTime`

Don't panic, there is more data in the file but let's leave that for the streach goals. 

When you are finished you should have a listing that looks like the schetch above.

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. So whenever you get stuck start with step 1 and continue until problem solved.

1. Google! In English, type in the error message if there is one, search within the language your're using (ie CSS, JavaScript etc).
2. Ask your code buddies in your Company.
3. Ask your fellow students in Slack.
4. Ask Damien. Please note: we are part of a sharing community - share the answer with your fellows.

### :boom: Success!

After completing this assignment you should be comfortable into working with re-usable components in React. You should also be comfortable in using your Javascrip skills to iterate over an array of data and create a dynamic webpage based on that.

### :runner: Stretch Goals

Done with the main task? Here's some ideas for things to continue with:

1. Add more information about the product on hover, use the `moreInformation` parameter for this. [Here's an example](https://www.apoteket.se/kategori/erbjudanden/) of how we're thinking. 
1. Make your page responsive and work for mobile and tablet. Use a 2-column layout on tablet and single column for mobile. 
1. Add a header to the listing that tells how many products you are showing. `xxx products`.
