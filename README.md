# Build a Product Listing with React

The task was to build an e-commerce store (in this case pharmacy), where we dynamically list the pharmaceutical products. 

### Stretch Goals

1. Add more information about the product on hover, use the `description` parameter for this. [Here's an example](https://www.apoteket.se/kategori/erbjudanden/) of what we're thinking.
1. Make your page responsive and work for mobile and tablets. Use a 2-column layout on tablet and single column for mobile.
1. Add a header to the listing that tells how many products you are showing. `xxx products`.
